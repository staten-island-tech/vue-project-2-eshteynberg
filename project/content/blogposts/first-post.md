## Top 5 American Restaurants

America is widely known for its abundance of fast food chains like McDonalds, Wendy’s, Red Lobster and AppleBees. Generally speaking, these are the stereotypical fast food that comes to mind when you mention “American Cuisine”. However, there is so much more variety than just “mashed potatoes” and “French fries”, you’re just not looking in the right spots. These are my top five American styled restaurants in NYC that you have to try at least once in your life.

Katz Deli,
Geronimo,
Union Square Cafe,
Bagel’s Bazaar,
ABC kitchen
