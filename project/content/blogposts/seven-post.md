## Szechuan Chinese Food

Szechuan Cuisine is one of my favorite types of Chinese food. Most people generalize Chinese Food into “General Tso's Chicken”, “Chicken and Broccoli”, or “Butterfly Shrimp”. However, Szechuan food is a thriller of spices melting in your mouth. If you’re looking for a savory kick in your mouth, Szechuan food is perfect for you! Normally, Szechuan cuisine consists of meat or vegetables marinated in lots of chili oil and combined spices. If you don’t have a good tolerance for spice, that’s fine too! There’s a lot of variety in Szechuan food as you can always get a classic Szechuan dry pot with mild level spice! If you love spicy food, I recommend the Szechuan roasted fish and marinated pork belly. These are classic staples when you’re ordering Szechuan cuisine!

Some of my favorite spots in the city for Szechuan food are:

Wu La Bu Huan 
Chuan Tian Xia
Szechuan Mountain House
Alley 41
Grain house
